                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p> Some of my interests are basketball, soccer, and swimming. My favorite basketball player is Luka Doncic who currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks. My favorite soccer player is Lionel Messi who recently won the World Cup and is one of the greatest players to ever live. When it comes to swimming I've always enjoyed being in the water but never really watched the sport that often and I'm currently training to be a lifeguard/instructor
                </p>
                <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <p> I got into basketball during COVID when I was bored and started playing with my friends around the neighborhood was very bad at first but later improved a lot. I played for intramurals at my high school later on in my senior year when I took basketball class where I refined my skills and abilities. I later started getting more into watching the sport and found out about Luka Doncic who was a rising star in Europe who later got into the NBA and is now on track to be in the finals tournament.
                <h2>Soccer</h2>
                <p> I always played soccer growing up and also played for my elementary school and participated in tournaments. Last year I played at the York intramurals and was a great experience to see how different players move with the ball. As I mentioned before Lionel Messi is my favorite player because of his playing style where he dribbles and passes the ball so everyone has a opportunity to score while having an amazing rotation.
                <h2>Swimming</h2>
                <p> I've been swimming since I was 6 years old been through the whole swim course and am now learning how to be a lifeguard and instructor so I can continue the cycle. Right now I am practicing my 400 meter swim in under 10 minutes so I can meet physical requirements as a lifeguard.
